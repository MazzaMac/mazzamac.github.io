snippet: "Joseph in wood grain, Joseph<br />
in curtain crease. A tiny Joseph waving<br />
from the fronds of a spiny succulent<br />
given as an engagement gift,<br />
a symbol of longevity.<br />
The kitchen light has started flickering;<br />
I think Joseph is in the wires,<br />
stuttering his hellos while I’m slicing<br />
pickles, my fingers dripping with acid.<br />
Joseph is getting under my skin,<br />
a skelf burrowing through<br />
dermis, muscle, fat,<br />
carving a route to my bones.<br />
Can he tell the two ribs<br />
that buckled to pneumonia?<br />
Simple fractures that healed<br />
slightly wrong and now,<br />
if I touch them too long or too deeply,<br />
I feel I could throw up my soul,<br />
or whatever it is in the middle of us<br />
that hovers – I imagine it<br />
a sort of wormhole, black and very absorbent,<br />
a pinprick in time, entrance<br />
to a slightly different dimension.<br />
If Joseph was a Halloween decoration<br />
he’d be one of the clean-cut<br />
glow-in-the-dark bats we’ve left hanging<br />
long past the spooky season;<br />
a remnant, a translucence<br />
existing at the periphery<br />
of the present tense"
