I've been featured in a video documenting my residency with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, celebrating the anniversary of Joseph Lister's incredible achievements. This is what they say:

**Joseph Lister is My New Flatmate** is a collection of poems by Marianne Macrae, our former Artist in Residence. The poems were part of a 9 month project looking at the life of Joseph Lister, who founded his principle of antisepsis in Glasgow in 1867. 

Marianne showcased a selection of her poems at Listermania, an event held at the College to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Lister's first lecture in antisepsis in 1868. This lecture was held in the Princess Alexandra room of the College, which is also where the Listermania event was held 150 years later.
