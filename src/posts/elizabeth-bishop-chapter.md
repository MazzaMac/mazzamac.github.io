I'm just about to have a chapter published about the use of Animals in Elizabeth Bishop's poetry - its coming out next month.

Now to be clear, this is an academic book published by Cambridge University Press - so it may not be for general consumption - and I had to complete the chapter at very short notice due to an impending birth of my child (!). So if it's your thing, [please take a look](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/elizabeth-bishop-in-context/animals/B52332653FBC37C1472862686D8D1120)!
