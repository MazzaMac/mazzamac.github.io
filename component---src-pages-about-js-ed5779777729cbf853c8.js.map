I write poems of a surreal bent, often featuring, you guessed it, talking animals. Sometimes they go in magazines and sometimes I read them out loud in front of people. I’ll no doubt give deets of these things in the weekly blog I’m planning on writing (based on what I know about myself, this is an ambitious amount of blogging).</p>\n\n            <p>\n            I also do drawings (see <a href=\"https://mariannemacrae.co.uk/category/art\">here</a>). I might, in time, put some of these wee critters on mugs and plates and ting so that should anyone care to, they can buy them, and then they can come to my café (website) and drink a coffee on me**, while they read my blog (<a href=\"https://mariannemacrae.co.uk/category/blog/\">here</a>). How very self-indulgent to paint this idyllic picture of your future lives revolving around your interaction with me. But for reals though, guys, thanks for looking at your screens in my name.\n            </p>\n\n            <small>*The WiFi is provided by you via your internet connection.\n            </small><br /> <small>\n**You provide the coffee.</small>\n\n        </Layout>\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby';\n\nexport default function useSiteMetadata() {\n  const { site } = useStaticQuery(\n  graphql`\n    query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n      title\n      description\n      author\n      siteURL\n      }\n    }\n    }\n  `,\n  );\n  return site.siteMetadata;\n};\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
