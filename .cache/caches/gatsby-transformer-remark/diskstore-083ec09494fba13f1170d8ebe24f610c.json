This involves pain across my nose, cheeks, eyes and forehead, aka all the places everyone loves having constant pain. Went to the doctor and got a sweet steroid nasal spray. This is the same doctor, by the way, who was inordinately excited the first time he looked down my throat because apparently I have a perfectly visible epiglottis, the likes of which he had never seen. So there you go. But less about the inner workings of this sanctum I call “body”. I think I promised some chit chat about my research this week, which I know you’re all really excited about, so I shall deny you no longer.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have never asked, i.e. all of you, I’m writing a collection of poetry featuring animals with voices and researching talking animals in other people’s poetry at the same time. The research is <em>complementary</em> to the poetry, y’see? I’m interested in why a poet might use an otherwise non-speaking, non-human animal to express difficult, human emotions. Speaking purely from my own experience, it’s just a darn sight easier to have a charming, cartoonish bear spouting about the pressures of life’s loneliness than to allow the reader to see the inner workings of your soul.</p>\n<p>But I’m fairly sure there are other reasons to give animals voices besides personal masking. Comic effect, perhaps? The idea of a pelican reading a sermon for instance, is (subjectively) funny. Pelicans can’t read, let alone become priests – I mean, where on earth would you find vestments made to fit a pelican in the first place? It’s ridiculous. And would, in my humble opinion, make a good set up for a poem that has the potential to entertain an audience. The question of what’s in the sermon, and whether or not I would be attempting to make a discreet observation about religion comes back to masking I suppose, but the overall effect would be a humorous one and so we could say the pelican speaks to elicit amusement.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ed4ec4009dc712aaf00685a878c30d3c/b4294/pelican.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 84%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Father O’Pelecanidae\"\n        title=\"Father O’Pelecanidae\"\n        src=\"/static/ed4ec4009dc712aaf00685a878c30d3c/b4294/pelican.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ed4ec4009dc712aaf00685a878c30d3c/e07e9/pelican.jpg 200w,\n/static/ed4ec4009dc712aaf00685a878c30d3c/066f9/pelican.jpg 400w,\n/static/ed4ec4009dc712aaf00685a878c30d3c/b4294/pelican.jpg 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>Father O’Pelecanidae</p>\n<p>Over the last decade or so there has been some discussion about whether or not it’s entirely moral to force an animal to speak against its will as it were, with an underlying insinuation that animals who speak in literature and human culture in general are mere puppets of our anthropocentric society, and portraying them in this way makes them ridiculous and therefore easier to exploit and/or kill. Say whaaaaat? Part of me thinks this is verging on absurd, but then I wonder if I’ve just been conditioned by the Judaeo-Christian structures and scriptures that are (somehow) alive and well across the world to believe that humans should be allowed to use animals however we want to because we are (according to God and Father O’Pelecanidae) the smartest animals of all. (The other side of this coin is the argument that portraying “soft” versions of wild animals has led more people to the conclusion that it’s totally okay to go into the woods and try to cuddle a grizzly bear, because Winnie the Pooh is an amiable little tub of fun. Not the case, folks, don’t do it.)</p>\n<p>So maybe that’s another reason a writer would use an animal speaker in their work, i.e. because they think they have every right to force words out of a beak or a snout just like they apparently have every right to slice a chicken into bite-sized bits for use in a stir-fry or a family fun fajita filler. I’m not here to judge. I mean, I’m literally having chicken fajitas for dinner later…and also writing loads of poems with animal speakers/characters.</p>\n<p>BUT…part of me would like to believe I’m doing it in an attempt to get closer to animals in general, to try and see life from their perspective. Okay, I realise turning a pelican into a priest isn’t exactly seeing the world from the actual point of view of a pelican, but I do write serious poems about animals and the challenges they face. Of course they will never properly portray the feelings or thoughts of an animal (guys, I promise I’m human, stop asking), but poems like these can show a level of empathy for the other creatures that share the earth, highlighting one of the things that actually distinguishes us from animals in the first place.</p>\n<p>And then I think, is it empathy or guilt? Have I written a poem about a roadkill fox because I’m trying to empathise and understand how shitty it would feel to be pancaked across a motorway, or have I written it because I feel guilty about the way large swathes of humanity have no regard for anything besides themselves? I don’t really have any answers beyond my own opinions and there’s not likely to be a definitive answer on this topic until animals get their fingers out and learn to speak for real. Aaaaand yet this is my life for the next two years.</p>\n<p>This has been a lot longer and more rambling than I originally intended and actually not about Debra Hassig’s <em>Medieval Bestiaries</em> as I promised last week – sorry to anyone who was despo to hear my views on it, I’ll try and sort out some one-to-one sessions for y’all in the future. Anyway I think it’s been good for me to hash out a few ideas into an incoherent, self-indulgent mess #soundslikemysexlife/How was it for you? Answers on a postcard.</p>\n<p>Here’s the rest of my week.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PhD Stuff</strong>\nI just told you, stop asking me!</li>\n<li><strong>Poetry</strong>\nPoem about the plight of a stag in the works. I know you’re all desperate to read it, but you’ll just have to wait…probably forever.</li>\n<li><strong>Comedy</strong>\nWe were oot watching Gein’s Family Giftshop on Wednesday night so slightly behind on the ol’ Bake Off – podcast should be up <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/me3comedy/great-british-bitch-off-with-me3-comedy-episode-3-quickbreads\">here</a> today though. Yet to watch Fantasia so It Disney Matter will have to wait.</li>\n<li><strong>Drawings</strong>\nHaven’t quite finished this week’s drawing, it’s been a busy time at home with visitors and shows and puppy woes so not had much time to myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise</strong>\nFuck it, I decided to just get fat and be happy. JK! Sinus infection kept me from the pool again this week, but should be raring to go Monday morning, yay!</li>\n<li><strong>Puppy</strong>\nThere’s been no noticeable improvement with St Chumbo’s Fire as yet. We’re pretty much at the end of our super long tethers. Choices are: A) pay lots of money for a behaviourist to see if she can help with the aggression (both bitten lots again this week), B) rehome him and be utterly broken-hearted forever, or C) continue as we are, until the day he unexpectedly bites a child and we have to have him put down. Watch this space, folks. (I will literally die of crying if it’s B or C.)</li>\n</ul>"}
